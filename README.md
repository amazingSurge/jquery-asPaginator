# Paginator

Paginator was designed to make implementation as easy as possible. Before implementing, make sure you meet the minimum requirements.

### Requirements
- jQuery 1.4.x or greater

### Implementation

For the most basic implementation, follow the steps below:

1. Download the [jquery-paginator](https://raw.github.com/amazingSurge/jquery-paginator) Package

2. Unzip the package and upload the following files into a folder on your website:
   
   -  jquery.paginator.js
   -  paginator.css 

3. On the page you are implementing Uploadify on, add a reference to the jQuery library.

4. Below the reference to jQuery, add a reference to the Uploadify script.

5. On the page, add a file input (or any other element with an ID works).

6. Initialize Uploadify on the file input.

7. Add a link to the Uploadify stylesheets in the head of the document.
